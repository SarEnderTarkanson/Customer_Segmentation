# Customer_Segmentation
This is an ML model that clusters the group of customers in our dataset.
Since the data had been preprocessed already, we directly pass to the preparation of our model.
However, before passing to the preparation, we need to mention that we will be conducting an EDA over our dataset.
We have 30 rows and only 2 features, which are all preprocessed.
K-Means clustering is used in the model.
That is a basic algorithm for unsupervised learning.
